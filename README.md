This repository aims to share builds of GE-Proton, custom built with WineGDK and several extra components.

## For Minecraft

**NOTES**: OpenSSL only works in protonified wine builds. You can use GDK-Proton (in the Releases section of this Repository) if you are not inclined to build proton from scratch yourself.   

To get online functionality working, you will need to follow this guide, exactly as mentioned:  
1) Download [mingw-w64-x86_64-curl](https://mirror.msys2.org/mingw/mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-curl-8.17.0-1-any.pkg.tar.zst) and extract it
2) In the extracted folder, rename `mingw64/bin/libcurl-4.dll` to `XCurl.dll`.
3) Copy it to Minecraft's binaries, replacing `XCurl.dll`.
4) Obtain SSL certificates from https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem and rename this file to `ca-bundle.crt`
5) **IMPORTANT**, Create a folder named `etc`, and under that folder create another folder named `ssl`, and under the `ssl` folder, create a `certs` folder.
6) **IMPORTANT**, Move `ca-bundle.crt` to this new `certs` folder.
if you've done everything correctly, your file structure should look a bit like the following image:
<img width="772" height="240" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6e27fc3-ecb4-46be-9448-800535bbc1b6" />

Now if you launch the game, the game should be able to phone home and get online. Just keep in mind that `XUser` is still not implemented so no Microsoft Account login yet.
